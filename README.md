# analysis_price_cars
In this project, an analysis of the prices of cars from the file was carried out using Python and its libraries, you can read more about the project in the cars file ``` cars.ipynb ```.

**Our task:**

Consider this scenario, our friend, Otis, wants to sell his car. But he doesnâ€™t know how much should he sell his car for! He wants to maximize the profit but he also wants it to be sold for a reasonable price for someone who would want to own it. So here, us, being a data scientist, we can help our friend Otis.

**Steps that are used in the following code (Short description):** 

- Import the packages
- Set the path to the data file(.csv file)
- Find if there are any null data or NaN data in our file. If any, remove them
- Perform various data cleaning and data visualisation operations on your data. These steps are illustrated beside each line of code in the form of comments for better understanding, as it would be better to see the code side by side than explaining it entirely here, would be meaningless.
- Gain the result
